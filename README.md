# unit-4-game


This is a game built during the bootcamp I attended. It is built using javascript, html and css. The purpose of the game is built on a black jack esque theme. The computer first randomly generats a number, and then  the user must recreate the number by clicking on one of 5 pictures each of which will generate a score. If the user can successfully generate a score that equals up to the original number the computer generated , then the user wins, but if they choose over the selected number, the user looses.
